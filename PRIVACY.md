# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to me.
This privacy policy explains how my extension (the 'Extension') collects, uses, and discloses information.
By using the Extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## Information I Collect

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This data is _never_ transmitted back to me.

### Information Automatically Collected

- **Local Storage**: I store data locally on your device using the browser storage API. This includes:
  - Parsed assignments from Canvas LMS.
  - User-configured settings such as Notion database property configurations.

### Information Provided by the User

- **OAuth2 Token**: To authorise with the Notion API, I collect and store the OAuth2 token.

## How I Use the Information

- **Fetching Assignments**: The Extension fetches assignment data from your Canvas LMS course pages.
- **Storing Data**: Fetched assignments are saved in browser local storage.
- **Importing to Notion**: Saved assignment data is imported into your Notion database using the Notion API.
- **User Settings**: User-configured settings are stored to customise the fetching and importing process.

## Information Sharing

I do not transmit any data to my servers except as necessary to complete authentication with Notion.
None of this information is logged.

Data is transmitted only to Notion's servers to import your assignment information.
All data is stored locally on your device.
However, I may share information under the following circumstances:

- **Legal Compliance**: If required by law or to respond to legal processes.
- **Security**: To protect against fraud, abuse, or unauthorised access.

## Information Security

I take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure.
However, no security measures are perfect, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Accessing, Changing, or Deleting Your Data

Since all data is stored locally:

- **Access**: You can access your data through the Chrome browser's local storage.
- **Change**: Update your data by changing settings within the Extension.
- **Delete**: Remove the Extension and clear your browser's local storage to delete all stored data.

## Data Retention

I retain your data as long as the Extension is installed and in use.
Uninstalling the Extension or clearing your browser's local storage will delete all stored data.

## Limited Use Disclosure

The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
This means:

- I limit my use of data to the functionalities described.
- I do not share or sell your data with third parties except as necessary to provide or improve my services, comply with the law, or protect against fraud.
- I do not use your data for personalised advertisements or other commercial purposes.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time.
Changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the Extension after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
